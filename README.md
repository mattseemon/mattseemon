#### Welcome to my world of incomplete projects.

I used to be a software developer up until a decade ago. Since then I have moved up the ladder, slid sideways on a ledge, jumped off the platform to something entirely different and jumped back on. All the while I never lost my interest in creating things.

I would always write a small utility for some random task I had to do. All these would just reside on my work machine or external storage, which would invariably get lost due to various reasons.

I setup a GitHub account primarily to have a place to permanently keep all the stuff I write, however random it is. Every project in here should be considered WIP and incomplete as it is mostly just stuff I am trying to learn.

Feel free to comment, critic on anything here. I know it will only help me improve.

Should you choose to use any of the material here, you will be doing so, with no guarantee from me that it will work as intended.
